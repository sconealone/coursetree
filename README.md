Course Tree
==========

A mock up of a degree navigator that shows graduation requirements
as a tree. Parent nodes are pre-requisites, and child nodes are
courses that can be unlocked by taking a certain course.

Right now, the only thing you can do is click on the tree. If you do this,
I pretend that you clicked CPSC 221 and bring up the course description
and Section List for it.
